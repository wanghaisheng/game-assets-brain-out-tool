# sucorn
pronounced as [su-kon](https://fubuki.moe/mascots.html)

A project to automate the collection of AI generated images on different platforms, and to classify which ones are good and which ones are bad, so that time spent during the ML/DL life cycle is reduced
The goals of this project include
- **deprecated** automatic collection of images using `pyautogui`,
- automatic collection of images through the [BingImageCreator reverse-engineered API](https://github.com/acheong08/BingImageCreator/tree/main)
- automatic collection of images with Google's ImageFx
- **WIP** automatic collection of images through [stable diffusion's](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) text2img, hopefully with automatic parameter tuning
- Automatic collection of Microsoft Session cookies using `WebDriver`
- Displaying these images on Discord for remote labelling
- Labelling these images from both remote (Discord) and local (tkinter) for training
- Using Discord for easy, persistent remote access of images
- use [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) for displaying statistics locally and on Discord
- **WIP** training of Keras classifier
- **WIP** training of Stable Diffusion LoRA (LoRA not included in this repo)

# Setup
> [!WARNING]
> There is no .exe file because I am a [stupid smelly nerd](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/2011)

It is recommended that a venv is used as there are a lot of dependencies (50>)
```bash
python setup.py
```

# Bot
Requires your bot token in `.env`, follow the setup guide
```bash
python sucorn.py
```

# Data collection phase
> [!WARNING]
> Use this ethically, as this makes requests to BingImageCreator. Avoid using too many instances as it will result in executing a DoS attack on this host.

### utilities/reverse_api/get_cookie.py

Load account names in the `normal` list in `usernames.json` and run this file. This will automatically get the session cookie for each account and store it into `cookies.json`. Credentials are taken from `.env`. The `loaded` list contains account names with the cookie acquired and stored

### utilities/reverse_api/run.py || run_linux.py
> [!NOTE]
> Replaces all double quotation marks in prompt with single quotation marks in Linux, keyboard ctrl shift r does not work either

Creates n-number of instances that will use the reverse engineered API to generate images from `imagedir/prompt.txt`. n-number of instances depends on how many pairs are found in `cookies.json`
If `imagedir` does not exist then `utilities/reverse_api/prompt.txt` will be used to create `imagedir/prompt.txt`
```bash
python run.py imagedir --delay 10 --max 20
```
Each instance here will have a cooldown of 10 seconds after downloading all images from the query before 

Keys:
- Tab: Brings the child processes to front
- End: Terminates all child processes
- Ctrl + Shift + R: Reloads prompt from `utilities/reverse_api/new_prompt.txt`. Currently unavailable

###### If it doesn't work
Try changing the parameters located in `BingImageCreator.py` TODO: instructions here

### utilities/reverse_api/.env

WIP
```
GENERAL=your_password_here
speckly=your_password_here
```

### utilities/automation.py
> [!WARNING]
> This feature is deprecated, use utilities/reverse_api

Makes use of `pyautogui` to automatically navigate the GUI, using mouse clicks and keyboard presses. The output is links pasted in a Discord channel. Run the Discord slash command `/nuclear_cat copy=<copy channel>`

# Data preparation phase
### features/sucorn_statistics.py
This is both a feature and utility, feature used for the `/statistics` slash command in Discord, utility can be used in the command line. 

```bash
python sucorn_statistics.py
```
Providing no options will iterate through all subfolders in `./images`
```bash
python sucorn_statistics.py --csv sample_statistics.csv --mode write
```
Writes these results out to a given csv file, ommitting the `--mode` flag will read the csv and display it using [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

### utilities/labelling.py
For supervised learning, we need to label the images
> [!WARNING]
> Do not run this with reverse_api/run.py, as there will be duplicate file names and overwriting will occur, will fix this later

```bash
labelling.py foldername
```
Ensure that `foldername` is a valid foldername in ./images
The following keys will label the image by moving it into its subfolder
- 0 for negative
- 1 for positive
- 2 for neutral
- ESC to quit

# utilities/reverse_imagen3/imagen3.py and get_auth.py

> [!NOTE]
> With effect from 3 September 2024, you no longer need to collect the Authentication header value, please follow the new steps below

Reversed API for Google's ImageFX also known as Imagen 3

Login to [ImageFx](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com), and then run 
```bash
python utilities/reverse_imagen3/get_auth.py <variable_name>
```
This will collect your cookies and store it in `.env` in the same directory as these files.
The variable name is a way of differentiating between different cookie strings, therefore allowing the
use of multiple accounts. See the example with `run_xfce4.py`. Suggest to name your variable name similar to the username you use for your Google account.

This will retrieve the cookie string from `.env` and use it to get an access token which can be used for generating images for the day. You can expect to generate about 50 images daily before getting a HTTP 429, stopping you from generating more for the day.

```bash
python utilities/reverse_imagen3/imagen3.py <variable_name>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afaf68b6-ba50-4a9c-af70-41d7dc19b9de)

`sudo python run_xfce4.py <foldername>` (more versions coming soon) will create multiple instances depending on how many variables are found in `.env`
A default of 8 images maximum will be returned per request

If a HTTP 401 is returned with the following message: `Request had invalid authentication credentials.`, it most likely means that the access token has expired. Follow the steps above starting from `get_auth.py`.
For now, you will have to manually remove the string from `.env`. TODO: automate this

Occasionally a HTTP 400 with message: `Request contains an invalid argument` is returned. It could mean that inappropriate content has been generated and therefore is not sent back to the client.
